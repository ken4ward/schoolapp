# Gitflow
Our project follows the Gitflow development process. As such,

* All new features should be made by branching `develop`
* New feature branches should start with `feature/` followed by the hyphenated name of the feature
 
See the [Gitflow Cheatsheet](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) for an overview of the Gitflow process.

# Work in progress
Please keep work in progress updated on Github. This helps the team know what tasks are in progress, and gives an opportunity to help with the task.

# Pull requests
When a feature branch seems ready for review, open a Pull Request by comparing the feature branch with the develop branch.

# Peer review
All code, aside from project documentation, should be reviewed by a peer coder before merging into development. This is intended to help reduce bugs and to improve code quality through a feedback process.
